<b> About BaeHacks</b>
 
BaeHacks originated from a few students at Mission San Jose High School in Fremont, CA. After being irritated by all the collegiate hackathons that wouldn't allow high-schoolers, they decided to create their own.

Located in the heart of the 'Bae' Area, BaeHacks is a premier hackathon for high-schoolers. It allows them to learn, code, and pioneer the future, all in a fun, friendly, and exciting environment.
